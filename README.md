# Balance Bot

Where all code should live. There may be some changes for CI to work properly but
I'll get those sorted out later. Docs can live in each individual folder as a 
README.

## To-do

- [ ] Motors must spin.
- [ ] Total latency between the control and the motor must not exceed 100ms.
- [ ] Stabilised bot must be controlled naturally.

- [ ] A control algorithm for a MatLab simulation.
- [ ] Translating the controller into a digital implementation.
- [ ] Accelerometer data <-> Control Algorithm (ESP32).
- [ ] Tuning the controller for unaccounted values.

- [ ] Power consumption <-> User.
- [ ] Remaining battery energy <-> User.

- [ ] Camera <-> User

Specifications need to be defined for the application. Automonous behaviour
must be shown.
